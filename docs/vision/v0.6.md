# Canonical v0.6 Vision

The canonical component contract in this repo is:

- WIT world: `greentic:component/component@0.6.0`
- Runtime target: `wasm32-wasip2`
- State API: `greentic:state/store@1.0.0`
- Tooling baseline: `greentic-component new|build|test|doctor|flow update`

Primary docs must assume this model first and only.

## Authoring defaults

- New components should be scaffolded from `greentic-component new` or `greentic-component wizard new`.
- Operation schemas should be non-empty and explicit.
- Capability declarations should be least-privilege and manifest-backed.
- Build + doctor should be part of normal authoring loops.

## Scope rule

If behavior is required only for backwards compatibility, keep it documented in `docs/vision/legacy.md` and mark it as legacy/deprecated in command docs.
