# Vision Docs

This folder defines the documentation contract for this repo:

- Teach and optimize for canonical `component@0.6.0` authoring.
- Keep legacy compatibility notes explicit, isolated, and clearly labeled.
- Avoid mixing migration/deprecation details into primary quick-start flows.

Read in this order:

1. `docs/vision/v0.6.md`
2. `docs/vision/legacy.md`
